| **Face** | Face detection using Haar-cascade or DNN methods. |
| **Hand Distance Detection** | Calculate distance between two hands or fingers using CV & geometry. |
| **Human Detection** | Detect humans in frames using ML/CV and raise alerts/actions. |
| **Invisible cloak** | Harry-Potter style background-based invisibility effect. |
| **Object Detect** | Detect specific objects using Haar cascades or pretrained models. |
| **Pose Estimation** | Detect and track human body joints with ML models. |
